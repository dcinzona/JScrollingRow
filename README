JScrollingRow
Copyright Â© 2010 Jeremy Tregunna, All Rights Reserved.

Overview

	JScrollingRow is a library that provides a view which is similar in nature to a UITableView,
	except that instead of scrolling vertically, it scrolls horizontally over its cells, which
	are reused as appropriate.

	It is early in development, and while it doesn't currently exhibit any known bugs, should any
	arise, please visit the bug reporter and add a new ticket exhibiting the bug, and what you
	believe to be the appropriate behaviour. I also accept patches, fork the repo and send pull
	requests, I'll review the code, and incorporate it.

Requirements

	JScrollingRow requires iOS 3.0 or higher.
